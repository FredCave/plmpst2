1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
We're here in the reality of life, 

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,640
With all the nature around us
We see

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,160
That the day will come when we're gone
And all this will still be here.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,680
About this situation
Rabbi Nachman says:

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,800
That when one find oneself
In dire straits,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
When he can't go on
Since life is hard, 

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,760
There are harder times 
And easier times,

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,000
If he remembers the afterlife, 

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Which will come 40 years later
When he's in the grave,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,440
And they let him out to such a place

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,760
What's the first thing he'll do?

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,520
Let's say it isn't 40 years later,

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,360
Let's say he has half an hour to live

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,480
What will he do?

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,800
Everyone has a different idea. 

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,600
He has half an hour to do something 

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,680
If he comes to a place like this 

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,920
He can get in touch with god,
He can pray, 

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,880
He can spend that time 

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,160
In a calm, positive place,

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,720
In Sacher Park.
